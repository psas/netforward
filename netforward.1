.SH NAME
netforward \- forward UDP packets between networks
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBnetforward\fR [ \fB-v\fR ] [ \fB-p \fIport\fR ] [ \fB-s \fIsource\fR ] [ \fB-d \fIdestfR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Netforward is a simplistic tool that reflects UDP packets from one IP
interface to another.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
This program uses only the primitive sysv-style getopt parser, so each
option is a single letter.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Verbose mode.  This displays the size (in bytes) of each forwarded packet.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fR
Selects the port.  Netfilter uses the same port number for source and
destination.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsource\fR
Selects the source IP address.  This should match the IP address of one of
the interfaces on the local machine.
.TP
\fB-d \fIdest\fR
Selects the destination IP address.  This can either be the address of a
remote machine or the broadcast address of one of the local interfaces.
